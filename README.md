# Architecture

![plugin_arch](plugin_arch.png)

# Getting Started

## Host Project

compile Neptune in application module of `build.gradle`.

```Gradle
    compile 'org.qiyi.video:neptune:2.5.0'
```

Initialize sdk in your `Application#onCreate()`.

```Java
public class XXXApplication extends Application {
    
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        NeptuneConfig config = new NeptuneConfig.NeptuneConfigBuilder()
                    .configSdkMode(NeptuneConfig.INSTRUMENTATION_MODE)
                    .enableDebug(BuildConfig.DEBUG)
                    .build();
        Neptune.init(this, config);
    }
}
```

more details and developer guide see wiki

## Plugin Project

If plugin app wants to share resources with host app, you need add dependency in the `buildscript` block of `build.gradle` in root of plugin project as following.

```Gradle
dependencies {
    classpath  'com.iqiyi.tools.build:neptune-gradle:1.1.6'
}
```

Apply gradle plugin in application module of `build.gradle` and config it.

```Gradle
apply plugin: 'com.qiyi.neptune.plugin'

neptune {
    pluginMode = true      // In plugin apk build mode
    packageId = 0x30       // The package id of Resources
    hostDependencies = "{group1}:{artifact1};{group2}:{artifact2}" // host app resources dependencies
}
```
